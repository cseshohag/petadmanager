"PetBazar.com" is a website, where anyone can buy or sell any types of pets. Pet-
Bazar.com sell only pet types products. In our country have many e-commerce web-
sites. But don't have any pet buy/sell type e-commerce website in our country. We
feel this gape, and decide to create a website, that will be buy/sell only pet animals
products. Customer can see all product without registering in our website. But if
he/she want to post an Ad on our website, then they have to complete the registration
process in our website. Our website will provide those features, like color, location,
price, name, type of pets, postdate based search and etc. We have messaging system
with seller and buyers. Buyer can contact to seller via email or phone. We have post
reporting system in our website. If someone post irreverent product, then anyone
can report against that post. Then admin will update/or delete the post. Buyer can
send direct mail to seller from our site. We solved our problem using e-commerce
strategy. E-commerce is the most visible business use of the World Wide Web. The
primary goal of an e-commerce site is to sell goods and services online. Although the
terms e-commerce and e-business are often used interchangeably, there are dierences.
Ecommerce is the buying and selling of goods and services on the Internet or other
computer network. Any brick and mortar store can become an e-commerce business
by adding a virtual storefront with an online catalog. E-business became an extension
of e-commerce to encompass all aspects of businesses that function online. E-business
involves e-commerce, but e-Commerce does not cover all aspects of e-business. Elec-
tronic Commerce is enabling the customer to have an increasing say in what products
are made, how products are made and how services are delivered (movement from a
slow order fulfillment process with little understanding of what is taking place inside
the rm, to a faster and retort open process with customers having greater control.
Electronic Commerce endeavors to improve the execution of business transaction over
various networks. It enables the execution of information-laden transactions between
two or more parties using inter connected networks. These networks can be a com-
bination of plain old telephone system (POTS), Cable TV, leased lines and wireless.
